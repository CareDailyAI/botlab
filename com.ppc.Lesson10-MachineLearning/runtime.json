# RUNTIME.JSON DESCRIPTION
# The runtime.json file describes to the server how the bot should execute, what real-time data it needs to access,
# how much memory to allocate to running the bot, how long the bot should run before killing it, and more.
#
# This particular runtime.json file in your base bot directory typically keeps track of version numbers and whats new information
# It could optionally contain more runtime.json information about what data the bot needs to listen to and what
# permissions are being requested from the user, but those are best left to the runtime.json files inside
# individual microservices packages (directories) to describe exactly what each microservice needs to execute.
# When generating or committing the bot, all runtime.json files are intelligently merged together from all the microservices
# that are being referenced, to form a single runtime.json file that contains all information to run all microservices.

  "version": {

    # Version numbers are strongly defined (follow this format) and always incrementing
    "version": "1.0.0",

    # Like putting an app on the app store, always describe whats new in the latest version of your bot
