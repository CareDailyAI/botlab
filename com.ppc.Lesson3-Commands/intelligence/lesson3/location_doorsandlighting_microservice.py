# All microservices must extend the Intelligence class

# Import an EntryDevice so we can see if the device that's currently sending a measurement is an instance of this.
from devices.entry.entry import EntryDevice


class LocationDoorsAndLightingMicroservice(Intelligence):
    """
    This class will turn on() all lights and smart plugs when the door opens, and turn off() all lights and smart plugs when the door closes.

    When you switch to a mode where the user is not home, the state of your lights and smart plugs will be saved, and then they'll turn off.
    When you switch back to HOME mode, the lights and smart plugs will be restored to how they were before the user left HOME mode.

    Now that you should be familiar with the workings of a microservice, we'll remove all the excess comments and logger methods, and
    build this more like a professionally written microservice.

    Explore com.ppc.Bot/devices/... directories to see what control methods are provided by various devices.

    I recommend checking out the following devices to explore what can be controlled and how:

        * com.ppc.Bot/devices/camera/camera_peoplepower_presence.py     - Provides control methods for all cameras provided by your smartphone app (use your spare smartphone as a security camera).
        * com.ppc.Bot/devices/light/light.py                            - Base class for lighting controls (on / off / save / restore / hue / saturation / brightness)
        * com.ppc.Bot/devices/lock/lock.py                              - Control smart locks (i.e. Kwikset 916 Smart Lock) (lock / unlock)
        * com.ppc.Bot/devices/siren/siren_linkhigh.py                   - Controls People Power sirens (play sounds, blink lights)
        * com.ppc.Bot/smartplug/smartplug.py                            - Base class for smart plug devices (on / off / save / restore)
        * com.ppc.Bot/thermostat/thermostat.py                          - Base class for thermostat devices (control modes, set points, energy efficiency and demand response policies)
        * com.ppc.Bot/touchpad/touchpad_peoplepower.py                  - Touchpad (play sounds, send notifications to the touchpad)
