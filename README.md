## BotLab

BotLab contains the BotEngine Microservices Python framework, a tool enabling businesses with a platform to create new features, AI agents, and services for individuals, communities and organizations on top of internet-connected data sources. 

These bots run 24/7 in the background of your life, making products do things the manufacturer never imagined. In the same way that mobile app developers can create apps for smartphones, now we can move beyond screens and add features and services that analyze realtime and historical data from internet-connected devices. 

BotLab provides:
- A **CLI Tool** for distributing bot services.
- A **data analytics** platform to process realtime and time-series data.
- Allows **Development teams** to distribute work across large or small organizations.
- A collection of **lessons and guides** to reduce the amount of time needed to go to market.
- Realtime **local executions** to monitor your products.
- Enterprise **cloud servers** to host and distribute your products.
- Various **accessibility** features to effectively communicate with your audience.

**You do not need to host your own server to run bot microservices.** 

We host and run them for you on our servers. Of course, you can also run them live on your local computer and watch them execute against real-time data from the real world.

## Just watch it work

Want to jump right in and watch a bot in action run? Playback some recorded data using the BotEngine in a new CodeSpace:

```
botengine --playback tests/data/14-days-of-data -r com.ppc.Tests
```

For help on creating a new CodeSpace please refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/features/codespaces) documentation.

## Partners and Services

BotLab can coordinate events and messages from various partner services, manufacturers and platforms.
