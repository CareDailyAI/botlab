# Maestro Command Line Interface

Usage: `python maestro.py` or `./maestro`

## Description
This has been a work-in-progress for developers and data scientists who want to extract device data and narratives out of homes for analysis. We sometimes edit the code directly to achieve whatever goal we have in mind. It doesn't implement everything Maestro can do, but it does help with data analysis.

The `api.py` file implements administrative APIs.

The `maestro.py` file provides tools to interact with a specific organization. Make sure your account has admin access, look up your organization ID in Maestro, and then you can use this tool to capture data from that organization. 

It is your responsibility to maintain security and privacy of the data you extract with this tool.
