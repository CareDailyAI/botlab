# Lesson 2 : Live Updates

When your bot begins running in someone's account, it's live. But you - the developer - want to update it and add features. It's like changing a car tire while it's barreling down the road while trying not to crash. 

In live bots, microservice objects have already been instantiated and their constructor methods have already been called, so how do you add more features and variables to these objects?

It turns out **the main thing you need to worry about are new class variables.** You can change the logic in your methods and nothing bad will happen (assuming you didn't add bugs to your code), but any new class variables you want to add to an already-running bot need to be properly instantiated. Failure to properly instantiate new class variables will crash live bots when your new logic attempts to access a variable that isn't there.

Let's cut straight to the point.

## Use initialize() to add new variables to bots that are running live
If there's anything to get out of this lesson, it's this one rule.

When you need to add a new class variable to a microservice that may already be running inside a user's account,
use the `initialize()` method to dynamically instantiate that new variable and add it to the class. Remember, the
standardized `initialize(...)` method is called at the start of each execution in every microservice. Follow this template:

    def initialize(self, botengine):
        if not hasattr(self, 'new_variable'):
            self.new_variable = None
            
If you don't do this, existing bot instances running in users' accounts may crash. It's not the end of the world: you can use `botengine --errors com.yourname.YourBot` to see errors from your bots running live on the server. In this world, you can fix the error and redeploy the bot instantaneously to fix the crasher.

***If you are a beginner and do not plan on commercializing your bot, you can stop the lesson here.*** If you are a computer scientist and want to flex your CS muscles, or if you plan to create commercial grade bots, keep going.


### Explaining why: Old objects in new classes

Class variables store memory that persists across multiple executions of the microservice. Class variables
are typically defined in the `__init__()` method. But there's an important behavior to note: the `__init__()` method only gets called
one time, only when the microservice is instantiated for the very first time. But your class definition for the microservice may 
continue to evolve over time as you continue to make improvements on an already-running bot.

Let's say you are working on a bot microservice and run it in your account. When you run it for the first time, the framework
will instantiate copies of all the microservices. The `__init__()` method is called one time per microservice, and class variables
are created. Each future trigger of your bot will keep using the same objects that were already instantiated on each execution,
and the `__init__()` method will never get called again on any existing microservice, even though you keep evolving the code.

So, each time you modify the definition of the class and run the bot, something crazy happens: you're actually running a new
definition of the class, against an object that already existed in memory which was instantiated from an older and now deprecated
version of that class! How do you ensure, if your latest class requires a new class variable, that this new class variable is actually
instantiated in memory before your new logic starts to try to access it?

The `initialize()` method gets called every time the bot triggers and before anything else executes, and that's where we check to see
if the class variable exists. If it doesn't, we create it. Now any logic in the new definition of your class that may reference 
`self.new_variable` will be able to see and interact with that variable with no problem, as if it existed all along.


## Best practices for commercial grade bot services

While the code above is sufficient to solve most problems you'll run into as a developer, there are a few more concepts to internalize if you're going to deploy and manage commercial grade bots.

Since the initialize() method gets called on every trigger and in every microservice, it is inefficient (on the order of nanoseconds, but still, don't write inefficient code...) so you should have a plan to
someday back off the dynamic initialization of this class variable in a future bot update (perhaps a few weeks from now) by adding
the new variable definition to the `__init__()` method, and also commenting a timestamp recommendation of when you can safely remove
the dynamically initialized variable.

Everyone's bot just needs to be triggered a single time for the new variable to become initialized, so
if your bot triggers on schedule once a week to send out an email, then you should let a minimum of 1 week pass to ensure everyone's
bot has initialized the new variable.

For the `self.new_variable` described above, here are some best practices:

Add the self.new_variable definition directly into the `__init__()` method:

    def __init__(self, botengine, parent):
        # New variable definition
        self.new_variable = None

Add a comment to the dynamically initialized variable in the `initialize()` method:

    def initialize(self, botengine):
        # Remove after August 2, 20__
        if not hasattr(self, 'new_variable'):
            self.new_variable = None

Now, any newly instantiated microservice simply starts out with this variable already declared one time. And later, you'll
be reminded that it's safe to remove the dynamically instantiated class variable from the `initialize()` method, making
your bot execute that much faster.

### Careful renaming or deleting microservice files

When your bot executes, it downloads your serialized working environment from the server and uses the Python library `dill` 
to unpack and setup your whole environment. If a previous running version of your bot created a microservice, and then 
your latest version of the bot renames or deletes the microservice file, the `dill` library will choke and won't be able to unpack your
environment. The result is it will give up, and all memory will be lost. The bot will start all over again as if it were
just added to the user's account fresh.

If you need to delete a microservice file, it's a 2-step process:

1. Remove the microservice reference from `index.py`. Commit / publish the bot. When the bot runs in users' accounts, it
will dynamically remove the microservice from memory.

2. After the new bot has executed at least one time in everyone's account (wait a few weeks), the old microservice is now 
gone from memory. You can safely delete or rename the microservice file if you'd like.

### Deleting an entire microservice package

If you are removing an entire microservice package, there's a safe and easy way to do this:

In your bot's structure.json file, move the offending microservice package from list list of 'microservices' to the list of 'safe_delete_microservices':

    
      # Share microservices across multiple bots by copying the target end-directory into the local /intelligence directory
      "microservices": [
        "com.ppc.Microsevices/intelligence/something_to_keep"
      ],
    
      # Safely delete these microservice packages from the service, without resetting live bot instances
      # Double check that the microservices listed here do not appear in the list of 'microservices' above.
      "safe_delete_microservices": [
        "com.ppc.Microservices/intelligence/something_to_delete"
      ]
     
This will add the microservice package and its files to your bot project, while removing those
microservices from actively playing a part in your service.
 

### Deleting class variables
If you need to get rid of a class variable, you will improve the execution speed. Remove the initialization of the variable
from the `__init__()` and `initialize()` methods, and delete the variable in your `initialize()` method:

    def initialize(self, botengine):
        if hasattr(self, 'variable_to_delete'):
            del(self.variable_to_delete)
            

### Large variables
If you have a large amount of data (>500kB) like a machine learning model or a picture, and if that data is not
required on every execution of your bot, then you could further optimize your performance by placing that data into
a separately stored botengine variable and avoid using class variables.

At a mechanical level, every time your bot executes, the class variables have to first get downloaded into the bot from the
server and populated. And when your bot gets done executing, all your class variables are saved back up to the server for
next time. No need to include a large chunk of data in that process if you don't need to access that data on each execution.
That's when you switch strategies and leverage two useful methods:

    botengine.save_variable(name, value)
    value = botengine.load_variable(name)

The `name` argument is a string, and the `value` can be anything. When using this method, the botengine will save and load your
variables extremely efficiently, flushing them to the server automatically when your bot gets done executing the current trigger.
If you load_variable() multiple times on the same `name`, only 1 API call is made to the server to retrieve the variable.

## Protected variables
If you have a small variable that must absolutely be protected against dumb errors you might make in the future, 
save it into a separate botengine variable space so it can remain intact - even if you break rule #1 or #2.

    botengine.save_variable("protected_variable", value)

If you need that variable on every execution of the bot, then add the `required_for_each_execution` flag when you save the 
variable. The variable will be available when the bot executes, which means the bot doesn't need to make an additional API
call to the server to retrieve it:

    botengine.save_variable("protected_variable", value, required_for_each_execution=True)
   

## Examples
See the code in `intelligence/lesson2/location_memory_microservice.py` for examples of creating a new class variable in the `initialize()` method, and examples of protecting variables in a separate memory space in the `device_measurements_updated()` method.

Run the bot:

    cp -r com.ppc.Lesson2-LiveUpdates com.yourname.Lesson2
    botengine --commit com.yourname.Lesson2 -b <brand> -u <user@email.com> -p <password>
    botengine --purchase com.yourname.Lesson2 -b <brand> -u <user@email.com> -p <password>

Watch it run locally:

    botengine --run com.yourname.Lesson2 -b <brand> -u <user@email.com> -p <password>
    
Pause it when you're ready to move on:

    botengine --pause com.yourname.Lesson2 -b <brand> -u <user@email.com> -p <password>
