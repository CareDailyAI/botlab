        This is part of a very scalable method to extract large amounts of data from the server for the purpose of
        machine learning services. If a service needs to extract a large amount of data for one or multiple devices,
        the developer should call botengine.request_data(..) and also allow the bot to trigger off of trigger type 2048.
        The bot can exit its current execution. The server will independently gather all the necessary data and
        capture it into a LZ4-compressed CSV file on the server which is available for one day and accessible only by
        the bot through a public HTTPS URL identified by a cryptographic token. The bot then gets triggered and
        downloads the CSV data, passing the data throughout the environment with this data_request_ready()
        event-driven method.

        Developers are encouraged to use the 'reference' argument inside calls to botengine.request_data(..). The
        reference is passed back out at the completion of the request, allowing the developer to ensure the
        data request that is now available was truly destined for their microservice.

        Your bots will need to include the following configuration for data requests to operate:
        * runtime.json should include trigger 2048
        * structure.json should include inside 'pip_install_remotely' a reference to the "lz4" Python package
